    "# Question 2: Crappies Fishing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the crappies fishing, structures of fishing locations are important, e.g., locations with shelters are preferred. Define the event $A$ as \"fishing at locations with preferred structures\", and define the event $B$ as \"fishing at locations without preferred structures.\" Assume all the other conditions are fixed. Assume the probability of catching crappies at preferred locations at a lake is $80\\%$ among all kinds of fish, and assume the probability of catching crappies at locations that are not preferred at the same lake is $20\\%$.\n",

    "### Answer\n",
