    "# Question 1\n",
    "Two gamblers decided to play a game involving rolling a *fair* die. Player $A$ agreed to pay Player $B$ $\\$10$ as an “entry fee” to play. The game consists of Player $A$ rolling a die until he rolls an $1$ for the first time. An example of a possible sequence of rolls in this game is ${(2, 6, 3, 5, 1)}$, with the number of rolls $N = 5$. Assume the rolls are independent\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a classic geometric distribution problem. Since this is a fair die, the probability of getting a success (getting a 1) would be 1 in 6 or $p=\\frac{1}{6}=0.1\\bar{6}$\n",
